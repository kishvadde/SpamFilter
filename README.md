This project includes email spam filter development using Naive Bayes Machine Learning technique.
Spam filter is implemented in python.

To use this code it requires to get the spam and ham email content to train and test the classifier.
As data is huge to upload i have not included here. If anyone wants to use this code download the spam and ham email data
and place them in spam and ham directories respectively. And as i have used corpus='C:\\Users\\Kishore\\spamfilter' to extract features from the emails stored in the given path, you can give the path where you have stored in your computer.

Thanks!!!
